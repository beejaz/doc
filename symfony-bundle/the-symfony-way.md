# Bundle Installation

This framework provides a Symfony bundle that will help you to use the components within your Symfony application.

{% endhint %}

## Installation

### With Symfony Flex

Symfony Flex recipes are provided through a dedicated repository. It is highly recommended to add this repository before installing the bundle.

```shell
composer config --json extra.symfony.endpoint '["https://api.github.com/repos/Spomky-Labs/recipes/contents/index.json?ref=main", "flex://defaults"]'
```

{% code title="composer.json" %}
```json
{
    ...
    "extra": {
        "symfony": {
            "endpoint": [
                "https://api.github.com/repos/Spomky-Labs/recipes/contents/index.json?ref=main",
                "flex://defaults"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```
{% endcode %}

Then, you can install the bundle or the complete framework:

```shell
composer require web-auth/webauthn-symfony-bundle #Will only install the bundle

#or
composer require web-auth/webauthn-framework# Will install the whole framework (not recommended)
```

{% hint style="info" %}
As the recipes are third party ones not officially supported by Symfony, you will be asked to execute the recipe or not. When applied, the recipes will prompt a message such as `WebAuthn Framework is ready.`
{% endhint %}

### Without Symfony Flex

If you don't use Symfony Flex, you must register the bundle manually.

{% code title="config/bundles.php" %}
```php
<?php

return [
    //...
    Webauthn\Bundle\WebauthnBundle::class => ['all' => true],
];
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="config/routes/webauthn.php" %}
```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

use Symfony\Component\Routing\Loader\Configurator\RoutingConfigurator;

return function (RoutingConfigurator $routes) {
    $routes->import('.', 'webauthn');
};
```
{% endcode %}

## Repositories

The first steps are:

* The creation of your [Credential Source repository](entities-with-doctrine.md)
* The creation of your [User Entity repositories](entities-with-doctrine-1.md).

You may also want to configure the other options offered by the bundle. Please refer to the [configuration references](configuration-references.md).

## Firewall

Now you have a fully configured bundle, you can protect your routes and manage the user registration and authenticatin through the [Symfony Firewall](firewall.md).
